## Description
This is a discord bot intended to be an easy-access database for information on all squishmallows, and also act as a foundation for my girlfriend's programming skills. When she becomes a cloud dev and makes big money, she's gonna say *"yeah guys look at this, this was one of my first projects!"*

<br>

## Files
For now, in the `src/` folder you'll find:
| File | Status | Purpose |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| `squishbot.js` | Not started | Handler for all Discord interactions. |
| `squishfinder.js` | Not started | This file finds information on squishmallows, for `squishbot.js` to tell users. |
| `?` | ? | ? |

## TODO
More features to come. She wants to add user-owned squish cards for card trading, so maybe in the future.
