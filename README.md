## Description
This is a discord bot intended to be an easy-access database for information on all squishmallows, and also act as a foundation for my girlfriend's programming skills. When she becomes a cloud dev and makes big money, she's gonna say *"yeah guys look at this, this was one of my first projects!"*

<br>

## Files
For now, in the `src/` folder you'll find:
| File | Status | Purpose |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| `squishbot.js` | Not started | Handler for all Discord interactions. Send messages, pictures, and Squishmallows from this file! |
| `squishfinder.js` | Not started | This file finds information on squishmallows, for `squishbot.js` to tell users. |
| `?` | ? | ? |

<br>

## Dependencies
The following [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) packages will have to be installed to run this bot:
- `discord.js` | Discord API
- `dotenv` | Access to environmental variables
- `node-fetch` | Allows HTTP requests to be executed
- `node-html-parser` | Allows easy parsing of HTML content

To install these packages after downloading Node, open a terminal and type in `npm install <package-name>`

## TODO
More features to come. She wants to add user-owned squish cards for card trading, so maybe in the future.
